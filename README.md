## About Focus:
Focus is a prevention driving simulator, developed as a prototype during the HackZurich 2016.
The purpose of the virtual reality prototype is to demonstrate how dangerous it is to use your smarphone during driving a car.

## Technologies:
Focus is based on Unity5 and was developed during the HackZurich. Based on an existing landscape project (SmallCity), we implemented some new features for insurance relevant topics.  During the test it runs on a Samsung S6 Edge with a Samsung Gear VR and an XBox controller or a Samsung controller. Thanks to Unity5 its no Problem to let Focus run on more platforms.

## The Vision:
Every driver has some driving habits that may be dangerous. Our vision is to provide a solution, for showing someone, how dangerous a bad habit can be and to show what can happen in the worst case. A possible provider for the prevention driving simulator is an isurance company with specialisation on non-health products.

The integration of a convertion from google maps to 3D objects is a feature that will enable more realistic results from a analysis. The behavior and the driving habit of a driver is different when he is not taking known routes.  

From business side it gives the possibility to get informations about the driving habit of an insured customer. An Insurance can assign customers to risk groups and predict a possible risk. To make the simulator test attractive to someone, a bonus on the insurance payment can be helpful.

## Feature ideas:
1. Customer prevention:
  - driving a car through a city with oncoming traffic and pedestrians
  - smartphone screen fixed on a position, usual low position hiding from cops ;)
  - sound or vibrating to notificate driver
  - game over when colision happens
2. Overall features:
  - generate 3d model from google maps, for getting driving habit within real environment
  - show/check driving habit in known and unknown regions
3. business analisys:
  - check habit of car driver for risk group assignment
    1. looking to the mirrors, looking what happens around
    2. agressive driving: Acceleration, speed, braking before curve

## Checklist features
1. Done:
